# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Nature-Inspired-Algorithms
• We detect the CC fraud detection using machine learning
algorithms.
• Dataset contains a 8,00,000 data points we need to split
the data points (80%‑Train) and (20%‑Test) data.
• Perform Machine Learning and Nature Inspired
Algorithms on the data.
• WhereNature Inspired Algorthims for Feature Selection
which can reduce data points.
• Before applying Feature Selection Accuracy ‑ 76%.
• After applying Feature Selection Accuracy ‑ 98%.
